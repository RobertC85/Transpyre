# Support Hardware
Tested on (although openly adaptable to your needs) the following hardware

x 1 Raspberry Pi 3b with 8gb microsd card with dietpi Linux installed (0riginaly tested very well on rpi b but you would be smarter to use 64 bit dietpi Linux on at least a pi 3b and upcoming TransPyre X will require it for using an SDR to take measurements
x 1 - 4 52pi dockerpi 4channel relay switch hat
x 1 stephen moss veronica or aareff compatible transmitter (you assume all technical and legal risks of using that kind of hardware without proper license)
this list will be ammended as the hardware side of things is also under active development
when that part is done i will tell you how to build it all then install the software and use it

# More info coming soon to this document!

# Transpyre 2.0 update coming late 2026
  This update will when complete wil controll far more features includint a much more powerful amplifier and redesigned interface (inspired by the old one of course) and support for a different linux distribution if using a raspberry pi, debian based alternatives for third party boards will be built when i can find the time after finishing alpine installatiion scripts

an all new front panel mounted touchscreen interface

secondary rs 232 controlled but otherwise offline sbc rpi or otherwise will controll the tuning and pll of the exciter directly. i still need to find out how to handle the pll digitally in software
