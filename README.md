# Support Hardware
Tested on (although openly adaptable to your needs) the following hardware

x 1 Raspberry Pi 3b with 8gb microsd card with dietpi Linux installed
x 1 - 4 52pi dockerpi 4channel relay switch hat
x 1 stephen moss veronica or aareff compatible transmitter (you assume all technical and legal risks of using that kind of hardware without proper license)
this list will be ammended as the hardware side of things is also under active development
when that part is done i will tell you how to build it all then install the software and use it

# More info coming soon to this document!
